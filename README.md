# Talk Calendar (Gtk4 Version)


## Important Note

**Talk Calendar which used the Flite speech sythesiser has been removed. Although I thought that the Flite (Festival Lite) speech sythesiser had a BSD-like license it has been pointed out that it may not be compatible with the license of the Talk Calendar project namely the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2 or later which was chosen so as to be compatible with the  Gtk project. I have also deleted the shadow gitlab project but I am still developing a Gtk4 calendar called [Tiki Calendar](https://github.com/crispinalan/tikicalendar)**
